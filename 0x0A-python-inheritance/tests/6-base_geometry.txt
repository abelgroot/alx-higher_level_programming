# Test 1: Create an instance of BaseGeometry and check its type
>>> BaseGeometry = __import__('6-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
>>> type(bg)
<class '6-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>

# Test 2: Call area() method and check for exception
>>> try:

... except Exception as e:
...     print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))
[Exception] area() is not implemented
